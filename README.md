Product Management Event at the Product Conference about How to Nail the Product Manager Interview.

Gayle taught how to prepare for Product Manager interviews, what top companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft really look for, and how to tackle the toughest problems. 

She also discussed how the ambiguously-named "PM" (product manager / program manager) role varies across companies, what experience you need, how to make your existing experience translate, what a great PM resume and cover letter look like, and finally, how to master the PM interview questions (estimation questions, behavioral questions, case questions, product questions, technical questions, and the super important "pitch"). 

Gayle McDowell is the Founder and CEO of CareerCup and the author of Cracking the Coding Interview, Cracking the Coding Interview and Cracking the Tech Career.

Gayle has worked as a Software Engineer for Google, Microsoft and Apple and has extensive interviewing experience on both sides of the table. She has interviewed and received offers from Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, IBM, Goldman Sachs and a variety of other firms, and she has interviewed over 120 candidates at Google and served on its hiring committee.
